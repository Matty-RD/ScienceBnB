# ScienceBnB

https://sciencebnb.herokuapp.com/
A site for Scientist to find willing Test Subjects!

# Description
ScienceBnb is a full stack application made for Scientists & Test Subjects to join a community.
As a user the ScienceBnB community, you will be able to post tests, edit and delete those tests, along with leave your own reviews on other peoples tests and view all tests on the website.
This project is developed with Express, Sequelize, React, and Redux.

ScienceBnB is a clone of AirBnB, but with a twist of SCIENCE!!!

I built out both the frontend and backend of the application.
